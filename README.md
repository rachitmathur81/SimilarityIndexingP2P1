Predictive Analytics Concept - IT Operations - Find Out Which Prio2 Incidents Look Like a Prio 1


Often in IT Operations (production), the operations teams encounter high priority and low priority incident or issues. There are times when incidents that are tagged as low priority cause an impact similar to high priority. This problem is often compunded by high volume of low priority incidents which makes it very difficult to identify such outliers.
The idea here is to find low priority incidents that look like a high priority incidents. The Operation teams can then be alerted of these cases and requried action can be taken to address such incidents (instead of waiting out and acting late as per the signed SLA)
